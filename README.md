# Ibeacon-Minew---MQTT---Node-RED
Used Ibeacon of the Minew brand, in which the MQTT protocol was activated in which the data is sent to the CloudMQTT and searched for these values ​​through a server Node-RED local, where it is presented in a dashboard.
In this case was necessary that send when the temperature was low and high one message in telegram using the bot. For send a message in the telegram you need add the plugin telegrambot.
I used the temperature and humidity sensor.
